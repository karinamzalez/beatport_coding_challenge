# JavaScript Code Challenge

Complete the test files that are missing code. Many of these tests come from actual code that we use at Beatport.

To get started, install the packages with npm or yarn:

```
npm install 
```

Start the web server:

```
npm test
```

Then visit [http://localhost:3357/](http://localhost:3357/).

You will see a lot of red test failures. As you complete each of the challenges located in `tests/`, these will begin to pass. You can run a single test by providing a grep parameter:

[http://localhost:3357/?grep=math](http://localhost:3357/?grep=math)

Feel free to use Chrome or Firefox, and use all of the latest and greatest features of modern browsers.
