# Beatport Code Challenges

In this repo you will find folders corresponding to the languages that we use at Beatport Engineering. Each repo contains a test runner and a set of failing tests. 

**The goal:** Complete the code so that the test runner passes all tests. 

Each folder contains instructions on how to set up and run the tests:

- [Python](/python)
- [JavaScript](/javascript)

Good luck!
